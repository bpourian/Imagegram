# Imagegram

This is a mock of the Instagram photo sharing site. It is built in Ruby on Rails
just like how the original site was setup at the beginning.

All development is done in TDD. Although the Rails framework provides some unit
tests, further tests have been carried out in RSpec and Capybara.
